        <p>For now, the information below is available only in German.</p>

        <h4>II. Personal data, purposes and legal basis of data processing</h4>

        <h5>1. Personal Data</h5>

        <p>According to the GDPR, personal data means “any information relating to an identified or
            identifiable
            natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
            directly or
            indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
            location
            data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
            genetic,
            mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.”</p>

        <h5>2. General Use of this Website</h5>

        <p>We do not collect nor record any personal data during your visit to our website.</p>

        <p>Without prejudice to the principle reasons set out above, the webserver of our hoster does register
            access
            visits and your IP address automatically.</p>

        <p>Additionally, our hoster creates logfiles to preserve system security. These logfiles contain the
            following
            information:</p>

        <p>the IP-address<br />
            date of access<br />
            the URL<br />
            content which has been accessed<br />
            the transferred information</p>

        <p>This information remains anonymous for us. Hence, it is not possible for us to draw any conclusions
            about a
            specific person on the basis of the data collected.</p>

        <p>If you contact us through the mail address provided on this website, you share your email address
            with us
            and possibly more information contained in your email. To process your request, we have to process
            this
            data.</p>

        <h5>3. Purposes and Legal Basis of Data Processing</h5>

        <p>The processing of your IP address during the establishment of the connection takes place so that we
            can make
            our website available to you. It is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest
            lies in
            the aforementioned purpose.</p>

        <p>The processing in the context of an establishment of contact takes place, so that we can work on and
            answer
            your inquiry. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the
            aforementioned purpose.</p>

        <h5>III. Recipient of the Data</h5>

        <p>Within our organisation, the departments that are responsible for dealing with your concerns have
            access to
            your data. In addition, we use external service providers where we are unable to provide services
            ourselves
            or are unable to do so sensibly. These external service providers are primarily providers of IT
            services and
            telecommunications services.</p>

        <p>A transfer to third countries does not take place in principle and only if it is necessary for the
            execution
            of your orders, is legally prescribed or you have given us your consent to this.</p>

        <h5>IV. Duration of Storage</h5>

        <p>We will store your e-mails and contacts for as long as is necessary to process your request and then
            store
            them for a period of 3 years if you contact us again with respect to your original question.</p>

        <h5>V. Rights of Affected Persons</h5>

        <p>The GDPR guarantees you certain rights which you can assert against us - as far as the legal
            prerequisites
            are given.</p>

        <p>Art. 15 GDPR – Right of access by the data subject: You have the right to obtain from us
            confirmation as to
            whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed, and, where that is the case, access
            to the
            personal data and the purposes of the processing.</p>

        <p>Art. 16 GDPR – Right to rectification: You have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the
            rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning yourself. Taking into account the purposes of
            the
            processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of
            providing a
            supplementary statement.</p>

        <p>Art. 17 GDPR – Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’): You have the right to obtain from us the
            erasure
            of personal data concerning yourself without undue delay. Please take not of the exemption described
            in II.
            4.</p>

        <p>Art. 18 GDPR – Right to restriction of processing: You have the right to obtain from us the
            restriction of
            processing.</p>

        <p>Art. 20 GDPR – Right to data portability: You have have the right to receive the personal data
            concerning
            yourself, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format
            and have
            the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to
            which the
            personal data have been provided, or to have us transmit the data to another controller as far as it
            is
            technically possible.</p>

        <p>Art. 21 GDPR – Right to object: You have the right to object at any time, for reasons related to
            your
            particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is necessary for a
            legitimate
            interest on our part or in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
            exercise
            of official authority.</p>

        <p>If you file an objection, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can prove
            compelling
            reasons for the processing worthy of protection which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms,
            or the
            processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>

        <p>If we process your personal data in order to conduct direct advertising, you have the right to
            object to the
            processing at any time. If you object to the processing for purposes of direct marketing, we will no
            longer
            process your personal data for these purposes.</p>

        <p>Art. 77 DSGVO in relation to § 19 Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) – Right to lodge a complaint
            with a
            supervisory authority: You have the right to lodge a complaint at any time with a supervisory
            authority, in
            particular in the Member State where you are residing, at your place of work or at the place where
            the
            infringement is alleged, if you consider that the processing of your personal data is contrary to
            applicable
            law.</p>

        <h5>VI. Obligation to provide data</h5>

        <p>You have no contractual or legal obligation to provide us with personal data. However, we are not
            able to
            offer you our services without the data you provide.</p>

        <h5>VII. Existence of automated decision making (including profiling)</h5>

        <p>We do not use any automated decision making process that may have legal effects on you or adversely
            affect
            you.</p>

        <h5>VIII. Internet Specific Data Processing</h5>

        <p>During the use of our Internet pages, we automatically record and evaluate technical access data.
            For this
            purpose we use the tool “Matomo” (formerly “Piwik”), an open source program for web analytics, which
            evaluates statistical parameters for the use of our website. However, this data cannot be assigned
            to a
            specific person; the individual user remains anonymous. Further information about “Matomo” can be
            found on
            the website <a href="https://matomo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://matomo.org</a>
        </p>

        <p>This data includes, for example<br />

            The IP address shortened by the last two octets,<br />
            Information about the Internet browser and operating system used,<br />
            the domain name of the website from which a visit to our Internet pages is made,<br />
            the average length of stay in our offer, and<br />
            the pages called in our web site.</p>

        <p>In addition, by removing the check mark on this site, we can prevent Matomo from counting your visit
            at all.
            In this case, a cookie will be set to indicate to us that you have objected to its use.</p>

        <p>Please note that the respective settings regarding cookies are only effective for your currently
            used device
            and your currently used browser. If you are using a different device or browser, you will usually
            have to
            change the settings again. We also support the “Do not Track” function of your browser. This allows
            you to
            actively tell us via your browser settings whether you wish your activities to be recorded or not.
            If you
            have activated “Do not Track”, your activities will not be recorded.</p>

        <p>The legal basis for the use of Matomo can be found in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our justified
            interest
            consists in the fact that we evaluate the use of our Website for their improvement and optimization.
            The
            data collected in this way is stored for a period of 24 months.
            IX. If you have any comments or questions</p>

        <p>We take all possible precautions to protect and secure your data. Your questions and comments on
            data
            protection are welcome, simply send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@okfn.de">info@okfn.de</a>.</p>
